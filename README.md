# RHIME CO2 Inversions 
Updated repository of RHIME code being used for CO2 inversions

NB. This repository is not good and will probably need some serious software updates to get it in a usuable format (i.e. easy installation procedures etc.)

Paths will probably have to be checked in pretty much all files. And make sure you've got OpenGHG installed etc. Oh, and you'll probably need to install 'pint'.

Anyway, it doesn't matter too much as this will all hopefully go into the main RHIME code soon!
